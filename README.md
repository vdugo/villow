# Real Estate Transaction Platform on Ethereum Blockchain

This project is a real estate transaction platform, implemented on Ethereum blockchain. The project showcases a simplified yet comprehensive process of real estate transactions by leveraging the advantages of smart contracts.

## Entities
The platform includes several entities:

1. **Buyer**: Initiates the buying process.
2. **Seller**: Lists the property for selling.
3. **Appraiser**: Provides an unbiased estimate of the property value.
4. **Lender**: Provides funds to the buyer.
5. **Inspector**: Checks the condition of the property.
6. **Legal Entity**: Verifies the property ownership and conducts due diligence.

Each entity is represented by an Ethereum address on the blockchain.

## Smart Contracts
The project includes three main smart contracts:

1. **Property NFT Contract (ERC-721)**: Enables the minting of NFTs to represent properties. Images related to properties are stored on IPFS.

2. **Bidding Contract**: Handles the bidding process on properties and ensures the highest bid is kept track of.

3. **Escrow Contract**: Holds the funds in escrow during the property transaction process and facilitates the interaction among buyer, seller, appraiser, lender, inspector, and legal entity.

## Frontend
The frontend is built with ReactJS. It provides an interface for users to interact with the platform. It allows property listing, searching, buying, and facilitates interactions based on user roles.

Please note that this project is for demonstration purposes and may not cover all aspects of real-world real estate transactions.
